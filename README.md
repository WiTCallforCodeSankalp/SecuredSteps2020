## Short description

### What's the problem?

Part of the World Health Organization's guidance on limiting further spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. As a result, schools in most affected areas are taking precautionary measures by closing their facilities. With school-aged children at home for an indeterminate amount of time,  keeping them engaged, entertained, and on top of their education is important.

### How can technology help?

Schools and teachers can continue to engage with their students through virtual classrooms, and even create interactive spaces for classes. As parents face a new situation where they may need to homeschool their children, finding appropriate online resources is important as well.

### The idea

It's imperative that learning and creating can continue when educational institutions have to shift the way they teach in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing a set of open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services, will enable educators to more easily make content available for their students.

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.
